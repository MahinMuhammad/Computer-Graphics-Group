# Airport View
In our project, we are trying to show an overview of an international airport. The view would consist mostly of terminal, big runway and airplane. There are building in the background. There are trees beside the buildings. In the sky few birds will be seen flying slowly. There will be people seen buys doing things. Planes will be seen landing and taking-off.
